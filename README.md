# ajaxi
IFRAME based AJAX library (AJAXI)

This library is aimed to solve some limitations found in the natural behavior and purpose of AJAX connection. They are intended for small data transfers and a few concurrent connection.

This library solves this problem by allowing "unlimited" AJAXI connection with queuing feature. It has been tested on MS IE 11 (edge selected from meta tag) and Gogle Chrome 40.0.2214.94. 

Feel free to use it and redistribute it if needed. I just ask you to keep some comments about the author (me ;). Also feel free to post any comment on the code regarding improvements and errors, thank you!
